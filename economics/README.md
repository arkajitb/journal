#### Budget Line
[Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/ap-choices-opp-cost-tutorial/income-and-substitution-effects/v/budget-line) to Khan Academy videos:
- Based on your income, how many goods of each type can you consume ?
- Indifference Curve: 
- Total Effect(We know this) = Substitution Effect(can be calculated) + Income Effect(duh)
    - When demand for one product increases, the slope will change obviously. But assume that the indifference curve doesn't change. See where a line with the new slope would be tangent to the indifference curve.
